# PSheck Hash

A simple but pretty utility tool to check the veracity of software, return SHA256, MD5 strings.

Yet another utility tool that does the same but with a beauty/minimalist look and feel, please feel free to contribute, the idea is to build a beauty skin on this one.

It uses the crypto module from node.js.
